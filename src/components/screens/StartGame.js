        Golang backend via websockets. You're welcome to try it out and send

          The game consists of two players. Player 1 uses the W & S keys to move
          up and down. Player 2 uses the Up & Down Arrow keys to move up and
          down. A player's score is incremented by 1 each time his/her pad
          connects with the ball. The first player to reach a target score of 50
          wins the game.
